# 🏥 Cardiovascular Diagnostic & Risk Analytics Suite

### **Project Title**
**Explainable AI Dashboard for Real-Time Clinical Perfusion Risk Assessment**

---

### **The Problem**
In critical cardiovascular care and perfusion, clinicians are overwhelmed with high-frequency data (MAP, Lactate, Hemoglobin, etc.). Traditional monitoring often lacks:
* **Predictive Insight:** It tells you what *is* happening, not what *might* happen.
* **Transparency:** Standard AI models are "black boxes" that clinicians don't trust.
* **Visual Correlation:** There is no easy way to see how multiple clinical parameters correlate to patient risk in one view.

---

### **The Solution**
This suite provides a professional-grade **AI Dashboard** built with **Python** and **Streamlit**. It bridges the gap between raw medical data and clinical decision-making by offering:
1.  **Risk Prediction:** Uses Machine Learning to calculate cardiovascular ischemic risk scores.
2.  **Clinical Correlation Map:** A visual heatmap identifying relationships between perfusion parameters.
3.  **Explainable AI (SHAP):** Provides a "Technologist Verification" section that explains *why* the AI gave a specific risk score, ensuring clinical transparency.

### **Tech Stack**
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Framework:** Streamlit (Web UI)
* **Data Science:** Pandas, NumPy
* **Visualization:** Plotly, Seaborn
* **AI Explainability:** SHAP (SHapley Additive
